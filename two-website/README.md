# Recreating a Template

In this Project I re-created a template into **React App**.

## Development

- Firstly, I divided the template into different sections like _NavBar_, _HeroSection_, _AppSection_, _CardSection_, _Footer_.

- Later, I translated those sections into corresponding components.
- I also, developed reusable component for _CardSection_.

### Required Files/Dependencies

- The template which is used in the project is located in the folder `/template`.
- For styling, I used **Bootstrap**.
