# Re-Creating Template - Two

In this Project, i recreated a template from a website [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer) into a **React App**.

- I divided the template into different modules like _components_, _layouts_.
- In those modules, i divided the template into different components like _Navbar_, _MastHead_, _PortfolioSection_, _AboutSection_, _ContactSection_, _Footer_, _CopyrightSection_.
- Furthermore, I divided _ProfileSection_ into few sections for each profile.
